          <p>Out of my love for teaching, I wanted to create a program specifically for middle school students in my community. Most programs focused on teaching students programming, but I felt students needed to understand the connection between software and hardware. Thus, in wanting to introduce a tactile engagement to software-based education, I created and taught an eight-week Arduino curriculum to middle schoolers. Hosted in my local library the fall of my freshman year, I provided each student with their own Arduino kit. My curriculum started with the basics of circuitry and programming and ended with controlling advanced components like motors and sensors. My modules included programming conventions, proper circuit practice, and fundamentals of computer processing. Students completed small projects on a weekly basis, and also learned the application of robotics in the real world. </p>
