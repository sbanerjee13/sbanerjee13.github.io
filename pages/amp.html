          <p>From March to June (of 2022) I designed and constructed a functional audio amplifier! I studied signal processing, acoustics, and electrical engineering to
          carefully draft <strong>three individual stages</strong> (filter, gain stage, output stage) and combine them to create a 5.5x gain amplifier!</p>

          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.7rem;">Circuit diagram illustrating the low-pass filter (left) and high-pass filter (right).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The <strong>band pass filter</strong> is comprised of two consecutive RC circuits. One acts as a low-pass filter and the other
          acts as a high-pass filter. Essentially, they only allow low/high frequencies (respectively) to pass through; the corner frequency values are
          determined by:</p>
          \[\large f_{c} = \frac{1}{2\pi(RC)}.\]
          <p>The impedence of a capacitor in an AC circuit is as follows</p>
          \[\large Z = \frac{1}{i(2 \pi f) C}.\]
          <p>With a given AC signal input at a given frequency we can determine the behavior of the output signal; furthermore, we can see how the arrangement of
          the two RC circuits differentiates the low-pass from the high-pass filter.</p>
          \[\large \lim_{f\to\infty} (Z)=0, \quad \lim_{f\to0} (Z)=V.\]
          <p>Additionally, the presence of a capacitor in between the signal input and the gain stage adds another function: <strong>DC blocking</strong>! The capacitor
          allows AC signals (i.e. signals with non-zero frequencies) to pass through while blocking DC (zero frequency) signals from interfering.</p>

          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.7rem;">Circuit diagram illustrating the output stage.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The <strong>gain stage</strong> uses four resistors and an NPN transistor to produce a predicted 6x gain. I designed the circuit to implement
          voltage divider bias as it removes dependence on beta (highly variable due to a myriad of factors). Using resistors, we create bias voltages and generally
          fix the voltage difference across $\text{R}3$.</p>
          <p>With this design, the input signal (initially passed through the band-pass filter) is amplified to ~6x. The voltage swing is translate to be centered at 6V
          with a +/- 5V peak.</p>
          <p>In characterizing the quality of this amplifier, I ran a fast-fourier transform and studied the harmonics to calculate the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).
          Using the following equation, I found the THD which represents how much harmonic noise distorts the output signal; I aimed for a relatively low number.</p>
          \[\large \text{THD} = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} V_{n(rms)}^2}}{V_{fund(rms)}}.\]
          <p>The calculated THD for this amplifier is $2.359\%$!</p>

          <br>
          <p>The gain stage properly amplifies the input signal; however, it lacks the current to drive the speaker. To solve this problem, I created an output stage
          which used a current mirror to maintain a 1x gain while boosting the current into the speaker. The current mirror essentially fixes the voltage drop across Q6
          which in turn fixes the current passing through the collector/output.</p>
          <p>On its own, the two output transistors still did not have enough current to drive the speaker properly. So, I added another "layer" of two transistors to minimize
          the base current requirement, resulting in an improved output. Additionally, I needed to use heatsinks (both commercial and some DIY aluminum ones!) because the capacitors
          would heat up quickly. This caused thermal runaway which impacted the circuit--I countered this by monitoring the current via a DC signal generator and using the heatsinks to
          keep temperatures relatively low.</p>
