          <p>From March to June (of 2022) I designed and constructed a functional audio amplifier! I studied signal processing, acoustics, and electrical engineering to
          carefully draft <strong>three individual stages</strong> (filter, gain stage, output stage) and combine them to create a 5.5x gain amplifier!</p>

          <p>An amplifier takes an input signal and increases its magnitude by some scaling factor. Most commonly, amps are used in the context of music to produce sounds at
          varying audio levels. However, as illustrated below, percieved audio levels differ from actual, measured "loudness" (i.e. sound pressure level scale).</p>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Lindos1.svg/400px-Lindos1.svg.png" width="43%" height="43%" class="centered-image"></img>
          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">Red lines illustrate equal percieved loudness levels for varying frequencies.</p>
          <p>Therefore, amplifying music volume by the same factor for all frequencies is ineffective. Furthermore, the <strong> goal of this project is to dynamically amplify an audio signal
          based on its frequency, resulting in constant percieved loudness regardless of frequency.</strong></p>

        </div>
        <div class = "block-p">
          <p>In an RC circuit, the charging equation for the capacitor is as follows:</p>
          \[\large V_{cap} = V_0(1-e^{\frac{-t}{RC}})\]
          <p>where $V_0$ is maximum voltage and $RC$ is the time-constant (resistance by capacitance). If we set $t=RC$, we get</p>
          \[\large V_{cap} = V_0(1-\frac{1}{e}).\]
          <p>Therefore, we can find the time at which the capacitor is $\sim63.1\%$ charged--this time is the time constant, so we can solve for the unknown resistance or capacitance. I used
          LTSpice to design a simple RC schematic and simulate its behavior. In this circuit, I used a $1\text{V}$ pulse signal, $100\Omega$ resistor and a 1$\mu F$ capacitor; some quick calculations told me the time
          constant should be $0.1\text{ms}$.</p>

          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">LTSPice simulation of a basic RC circuit with quantities described above.</p>

          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">Transient analysis of the voltage across the capacitor.</p>
          <img src="images/RC_DAta.png" width="50%" height="50%" class="centered-image" style="border: 3px solid #5b5882;"></img>
          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">From the data, the horizontal difference ($\Delta t$) is the time constant; i.e. $152\mu s$ or $0.152\text{ms}$.</p>
          <p>Next I built the circuit and used the oscilloscope to analyze the real circuit. I measured the voltage across the capacitor using the oscilloscope.</p>
          <img src="images/RC_Data_Real.jpg" width="60%" height="60%" class="centered-image" style="border: 3px solid #5b5882;"></img>
          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">Again, the horizontal difference ($\Delta t$) is the time constant; i.e. $166\mu s$ or $0.166\text{ms}$.</p>
          <p>In comparing the calculated (ideal) value, the simulated value, and the real value, I found the data to be relatively consistent! I experimentally found an RC value of
          $0.159\text{ms}$, which isn't far off from the calculated $0.1\text{ms}$. Capacitors are a great way to store charges in circuits and then release them at a later point in time.
          Additionally, I explored the relationship between voltage and charge in a capacitor by applying some calculus.</p>
          \[\large \text{Q = CV},\]
          \[\large \frac{d\text{Q}}{dt} = C\frac{d\text{V}}{dt}, \]
          \[\int \\dQ = C\int \\dV.\]
          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">The graph of $V_{cap}$ is a phase shift away from the graph of $\frac{d\text{V}}{dt}$. The integral equation is unecessary, but I just think it looks cool :)</p>

        <div class = "block-p">
          <p>Diodes are electrical components that allow current to flow only in one direction. Diodes contain an electric field at the barrier between the N-type cathode and P-type anode; this is called the depletion region.
          When a forward bias is established, it allows current to flow. However, the applied voltage must exceed the potential difference across the depletion region or current will not flow, i.e. the applied voltage must overcome
          the diffusion-based electric field.</p>

          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">Graph of Voltage vs. Current for a diode. Negative x-axis is reverse bias, positive is forward bias. Internal electric field is often $\sim0.6\text{V}$</p>
          <p>I designed a circuit via LTSPice involving a sine voltage, a standard $\text{1N4148}$ Diode, and a $100\Omega$ resistor. Modifying the transient analysis tools, I plotted the Current (I) vs. Voltage (V) to produce the expected graph.
          It displayed an internal voltage of $0.6\text{V}$.</p>

          <p class = "p-center" style="color:gray; font-size:0.8rem;">Analysis of the current through the diode. Applying either a reverse bias voltage or a voltage below the internal threshold resulted in zero current.</p>
          <p>Diodes can be used to convert Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC). Also, by only applying a current in one direction, it can keep electrical components safe from power surges.</p>
