          <p>I am the president of my school’s Math Engineering and Science Achievement (MESA) club, which provides peer tutoring for STEM classes. Our goal is to help students gain confidence in challenging subjects and foster a collaborative and supportive learning environment. I tutor physics, math (algebra, trigonometry, calculus, etc.), and computer science. My job as
            president is to manage the club both internally (e.g. overseeing the board, organizing tutors/members, planning competitions and events, etc.) and externally (e.g. advertisement, directing interventions, etc.). Initially, we met once a week after school; upon realizing many students cannot attend our sessions due to work or sports, I added another session during school hours to accommodate them. This has helped several students get the help they need from our club.</p>
