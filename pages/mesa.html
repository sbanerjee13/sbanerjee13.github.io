          <p>I am on the board of my school’s Math Engineering and Science Achievement (MESA) club, which provides peer tutoring for STEM classes. Our goal is to help students get comfortable with challenging subjects and foster a collaborative and supportive learning environment. I tutor trigonometry, algebra, and calculus, as well as both on-level and AP physics. I am also the media manager responsible for maintaining the club’s social media platforms, including its Instagram page and website. I promote STEM-based opportunities and academic resources on the MESA website, such as summer programs and study resources. Initially, we met once a week after school; upon realizing many students cannot attend our sessions due to work or sports, I added another session during school hours to accommodate them. This has helped several students get the help they need from our club.</p>
