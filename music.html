              [October 2023]
              <br><br>
              “I had 50 views for 15 years, and now I make a living from it"<br>— JPEGMAFIA, 2023
              <br><br>
              JPEG strikes an intoxicating balance of forward-thinking innovation and laid-back familiarity
              in his music, pairing some of the wildest beats I’ve ever heard with sticky modern flows to
              completely captivate and electrify listeners. He’s manufactured an outstandingly unique aesthetic
              to accompany his music: think a cynical, internet-addicted, balding, and strongly opinionated man
              (but like, the complete opposite of an incel). I mean that in the best possible way.
              <br><br>
              Seminal group A Tribe Called Quest famously samples Lou Reed in “Can I Kick It?”, resulting in a
              relaxing instrumental that perfectly supports Tribe’s naturally slick delivery. What I’m trying to
              say is, the beat just makes <i>sense</i>.
              <br><br>
              Then I listen to JPEG’s “NEMO!” from <i>LP!</i> and I wonder how on earth someone even comes up with such a
              deranged beat. Only JPEG could even think to rap over it. Which he does, and it’s phenomenal. This
              happens to be a trend [citation: “Baby I’m Bleeding”, “BMT!”, “Rainbow Six”, “Thug Tears”].
              <br><br>
              JPEG makes intentionally challenging music in two ways: (1) it challenges him to find innovative flows
              and (2) it challenges us to piece the sonic components together and decide whether we like it. Sadly, this
              musical philosophy seldom garners much support; most people don't actively <i>think</i> about the music
              they listen to. I see this philosophy internalized by artists like Danny Brown, Bon Iver,
              James Blake, Death Grips, George Clanton, and (yes) Ecco2k [e]. I respect these artists greatly for fearlessly
              diving into unknown soundscapes, emerging with eccentric sonic ideas people may not like.
              <br><br>
              It’s this philosophy intertwined with JPEGMAFIA’s fiery passion for music, impressive sampling chops, creative
              musical vision, and cult-like image/persona that makes him so unbelievably unique.
              <br><br>
              You couldn’t possibly make music like Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks. You wouldn’t even know where to start.

          <h1>Notes on 8 (circle)</h1>
          <p>
            There’s this [deeply resonant] recording of Bon Iver performing “8 (circle)” at Pioneer Works, published via NPR’s Music channel.
            <br><br>

            Through the audience’s applause, a single synthesizer chord permeates the atmosphere. It’s like a spell that silences the crowd, but somehow it feels like they’re not <i>just</i> quiet out of respect for the performer.
            <br><br>

            The chord is an image; a family, a sky, a child. The chord is an intangible; a feeling, a memory, a journey.
            <br><br>

            And in the brief moment before the drums punctuate the music, it’s as if the audience is forced to confront the chord in its entirety, a raw and vulnerable manifestation of
            their inner Self. There’s a sense of kinship within the crowd, as no one <i>knows</i> each other but everyone <i>understands</i> each other. In the face of such an evocative opening,
            burdens become real but weightless—lifted off listeners’ shoulders and placed in front of them. The music speaks for them => [a vehicle for the inexpressible]. It rips the
            unrecognizable from within, but emboldens them to face it with poise.
            <br><br>

            A year ago, I wouldn’t have regarded "8 (circle)" as being particularly profound. It’s not that I lacked “images” that inexplicably pervaded my subconscious. Rather, I’d have to
            <i>argue</i> their connection to the music, like saying a lyric reminds me of some[thing, one]. In that sense, <i>I'd</i> be responsible for assigning significance to the song. It's not
            necessarily less meaningful, just… less powerful.
            <br><br>

            This is what sticks out to me: sometimes music is thrust upon you and ends up fostering a deep relationship with you. When you embrace it, and allow the music to consume you, you’ll discover it’s much more than  rhythm and harmony, sound and silence.
            It'll articulate what you can't say, enunciate voids you can't fill, and comfort what you can't address.
            <br><br>

            Music has a way of finding you in life. You can spend your time searching for that which resonates with your being, but I’ve found that the [right] sound waves will seek you instead.
            <br><br>

            [!] The opening chord of “8 (circle)” is exactly the same as that which opens “End” by ClownCore, a song of similar effect. Reminiscent soundscapes aren’t uncommon, but it’s just interesting to see the same harmonic idea represented in completely different contexts.
