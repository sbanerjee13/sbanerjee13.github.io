              [June 2023]
              <br><br>

              Consider how computers interpret music—abstracting rhythm & sound to
              quantized sine waves & layering it back into cohesive amalgamations of sonic
              achievement. With this process, what do we learn about the music; perhaps
              even ourselves?
              <br><br>

              How can the way in which we frame music define how we engage with it?
              <br><br>

              [!] Computers that process music conceptualize songs in binary,
              interpreting harmonies and rhythm as latent bytes. In that sense, the
              reconstruction process is full of flaws, as quantizing sound tends to
              omit intricacies that might serve as salient elements of the music.
              <br><br>

              And this, perhaps, implies something deeper: modern computation
              is “soullessly” programmed to absorb, process, and create sound. Bits
              controlling bits without an “ear” for the music it works with. So then,
              our reception of the music is entirely in the hands of semiconductors
              and their electrical signals; in other words, we give something uniquely
              human to something uniquely inhuman.
              <br><br>

              Modern music is only as good as the transistors that process it. So in the end,
              live music will always better than recorded versions.
              <br><br>

              ...right?

          <h1>Notes on 8 (circle)</h1>
          <p>
            There’s this [deeply resonant] recording of Bon Iver performing “8 (circle)” at Pioneer Works, published via NPR’s Music channel.
            <br><br>

            Through the audience’s applause, a single synthesizer chord permeates the atmosphere. It’s like a spell that silences the crowd, but somehow it feels like they’re not <i>just</i> quiet out of respect for the performer.
            <br><br>

            The chord is an image; a family, a sky, a child. The chord is an intangible; a feeling, a memory, a journey.
            <br><br>

            And in the brief moment before the drums punctuate the music, it’s as if the audience is forced to confront the chord in its entirety, a raw and vulnerable manifestation of
            their inner Self. There’s a sense of kinship within the crowd, as no one <i>knows</i> each other but everyone <i>understands</i> each other. In the face of such an evocative opening,
            burdens become real but weightless—lifted off listeners’ shoulders and placed in front of them. The music speaks for them => [a vehicle for the inexpressible]. It rips the
            unrecognizable from within, but emboldens them to face it with poise.
            <br><br>

            A year ago, I wouldn’t have regarded "8 (circle)" as being particularly profound. It’s not that I lacked “images” that inexplicably pervaded my subconscious. Rather, I’d have to
            <i>argue</i> their connection to the music, like saying a lyric reminds me of some[thing, one]. In that sense, <i>I'd</i> be responsible for assigning significance to the song. It's not
            necessarily less meaningful, just… less powerful.
            <br><br>

            This is what sticks out to me: sometimes music is thrust upon you and ends up fostering a deep relationship with you. When you embrace it, and allow the music to consume you, you’ll discover it’s much more than  rhythm and harmony, sound and silence.
            It'll articulate what you can't say, enunciate voids you can't fill, and comfort what you can't address.
            <br><br>

            Music has a way of finding you in life. You can spend your time searching for that which resonates with your being, but I’ve found that the [right] sound waves will seek you instead.
            <br><br>

            [!] The opening chord of “8 (circle)” is exactly the same as that which opens “End” by ClownCore, a song of similar effect. Reminiscent soundscapes aren’t uncommon, but it’s just interesting to see the same harmonic idea represented in completely different contexts.
