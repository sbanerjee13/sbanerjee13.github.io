              [June 2023]
              <br><br>

              Consider how computers interpret music—abstracting rhythm & sound to
              quantized sine waves & layering it back into cohesive amalgamations of sonic
              achievement. With this process, what do we learn about the music; perhaps
              even ourselves?
              <br><br>

              How can the way in which we frame music define how we engage with it?
              <br><br>

              [!] Computers that process music conceptualize songs in binary,
              interpreting harmonies and rhythm as latent bytes. In that sense, the
              reconstruction process is full of flaws, as quantizing sound tends to
              omit intricacies that might serve as salient elements of the music.
              <br><br>

              And this, perhaps, implies something deeper: modern computation
              is “soullessly” programmed to absorb, process, and create sound. Bits
              controlling bits without an “ear” for the music it works with. So then,
              our reception of the music is entirely in the hands of semiconductors
              and their electrical signals; in other words, we give something uniquely
              human to something uniquely inhuman.
              <br><br>

              Modern music is only as good as the transistors that process it. So in the end,
              live music will always better than recorded versions.
              <br><br>

              ...right?

          <h1>Notes on A Moon Shaped Pool</h1>
          <p>
            Radiohead accomplishes something outstandingly unique on this record, in that they convey a
            powerful overarching theme of “grayness” and desolation through sonic ambience. Glittery and
            wet piano notes drift across the soundscape, accompanied by distant and soft instrumental
            feedback. Hearing the felt on the piano keys invoke melodies and chords invites the listener to a
            private concert; simply between them and Radiohead, in a clouded hall, surrounded by a
            tangible aura of grief.
            <br><br>

            Listening (*with headphones) to tracks like Daydreaming and Identikit, all the aural details emerge.
            It’s not the patterned piano, synths, and percussion lines that define the album, but rather how
            they’re coated in dreamy and detached artifacts that create the audiovisual landscape.
            <br><br>

            This record boasts organic composition and a deeply vulnerable soul; it’s consistent in its theme
            and persistent in the heart. It’s a different [art] rock record. It’s intentional in its barren and
            reductive thought, and all for the better.
