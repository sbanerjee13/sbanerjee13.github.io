                <p>You are offering free donuts as a celebration for your company's grand opening. People can line up in front of your donut stand and get a donut, given that they write down their name and e-mail on a "contact info" paper. As the day goes on (and you recieve more supply of donuts), you begin to realize that one man keeps changing his outfits and coming back to the table to get a second donut. Additionally, he changes his name so that he doesn't get cauught. However, you realize that he only changes his name by a few letters (never a completely different name), and that his fake names always have the same number of letters as his real name. To clarify, if the thief has a name with <i>X</i> letters, he will, at most, change <i>X-1</i> of the letters in his name. Given a list of names, determine which are fake.
