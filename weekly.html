                <p>You are the Mahavirus, a virulent and potent disease that can actually change the genetic code of humans, causing immunodeficiency (essentially, you are cancer). Given a string representing the genetic code of a human, determine the minimum amount of time it will take you to convert all of the genes into mahanine (M).
                    
                However, you can only attack the gene in a specific way. Here are the rules:
                <br><br>1) You can only start by converting a guanine (G) into a mahanine (M). After the starting point, you can, in one unit of time, convert <strong>one more</strong> guanine and turn it into mahanine.
                <br>2) You can only infect a target to your left and/or right if they are adenine or guanine, in which case you can convert them into mahanine (M).
                <br>3) Any cytosine to your direct left and/or right you can convert into adenine.
                <br>4) The only way to convert a thymine into mahanine is to have it surrounded by mahanine. <br><br>
                    
                For every unit of time, as many of the 4 "moves" as possible will occur. For example, if you have the string <i>AGGGCCTCCGGAG</i>, in one unit of time it will convert into <i>AGGMCCTCCGGAG</i>. Then, in <span class = "mid-code">time = 2</span>, the string becomes <i>AGMMACTCCMGAG</i>. In <span class = "mid-code">time = 3</span>, it will become <i>AMMMMATCAMMAM</i>. This continues until <span class = "mid-code">time = n</span>, where the string is <i>MMMMMMMMMMMMM</i>.
                    <br><br>
                <strong>INPUT:</strong> <br>
                The first and only line of the input is a string which represents the target human's genetic code line.
                    <br><br>
                <strong>OUTPUT:</strong> <br>
                The output should be the <strong>minimum</strong> time it takes to fully convert the gene code into mahanine.
                    <br><br>
                <strong>TEST INPUT:</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>
                AGGGCCTCCGGAG<br>

                <p>
                The answer of <i>MMMMMMMMMMMMM</i> can be created in 6 moves: <br><br>
                0) AGGGCCTCCGGAG<br>
                1) AGGMCCTCCGGAG<br>
                2) AGMMACTCCMGAG<br>
                3) AMMMMATCAMMAM<br>
                4) MMMMMMTCMMMMM<br>
                5) MMMMMMTMMMMMM<br>
                6) MMMMMMMMMMMMM

                <strong>Note:</strong> This problem is not realistic. Though nucleic acid <i>is</i> encoded in G-C-A-T format, the lengths of the genetic codes used in this problem are not realistic lengths.
