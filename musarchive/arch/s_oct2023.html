            <i>Statement</i> [October 2023]
            <br><br>
            “I had 50 views for 15 years, and now I make a living from it"<br>— JPEGMAFIA, 2023
            <br><br>
            JPEG strikes an intoxicating balance of forward-thinking innovation and laid-back familiarity
            in his music, pairing some of the wildest beats I’ve ever heard with sticky modern flows to
            completely captivate and electrify listeners. He’s manufactured an outstandingly unique aesthetic
            to accompany his music: think a cynical, internet-addicted, balding, and strongly opinionated man
            (but like, the complete opposite of an incel). I mean that in the best possible way.
            <br><br>
            Seminal group A Tribe Called Quest famously samples Lou Reed in “Can I Kick It?”, resulting in a
            relaxing instrumental that perfectly supports Tribe’s naturally slick delivery. What I’m trying to
            say is, the beat just makes <i>sense</i>.
            <br><br>
            Then I listen to JPEG’s “NEMO!” from <i>LP!</i> and I wonder how on earth someone even comes up with such a
            deranged beat. Only JPEG could even think to rap over it. Which he does, and it’s phenomenal. This
            happens to be a trend [citation: “Baby I’m Bleeding”, “BMT!”, “Rainbow Six”, “Thug Tears”].
            <br><br>
            JPEG makes intentionally challenging music in two ways: (1) it challenges him to find innovative flows
            and (2) it challenges us to piece the sonic components together and decide whether we like it. Sadly, this
            musical philosophy seldom garners much support; most people don't actively <i>think</i> about the music
            they listen to. I see this philosophy internalized by artists like Danny Brown, Bon Iver,
            James Blake, Death Grips, George Clanton, and (yes) Ecco2k [e]. I respect these artists greatly for fearlessly
            diving into unknown soundscapes, emerging with eccentric sonic ideas people may not like.
            <br><br>
            It’s this philosophy intertwined with JPEGMAFIA’s fiery passion for music, impressive sampling chops, creative
            musical vision, and cult-like image/persona that makes him so unbelievably unique.
            <br><br>
            You couldn’t possibly make music like Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks. You wouldn’t even know where to start.
