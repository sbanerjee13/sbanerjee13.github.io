                <p>You are in charge of ordering books 8 books on a shelf in a library: Candyland, Central Data, Cinderhulk, Clownman Begins, CMOS Integration, Codename: Monkey, Cute Dogs, and Cynthia's Story. However, the head librarian has demanded that certain books be next to each other. Because of state library standards, books must be as close to alphabetical order as possible. Given this information, please determine the <i>lexicographically smallest</i> permutation of books possible, given an <i>n</i> number of instructions (demands).
                    <br><br>
                <strong>INPUT:</strong> <br>
                The first line of the input is <i>n</i>. The next <i>n</i> lines describe a demand from the head librarian. The format of the demand is as such: "<i>X</i> must be placed beside <i>Y</i>", where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are the titles of books.
                    <br><br>
                <strong>OUTPUT:</strong> <br>
                The output consists of 8 lines, each with the title of a book. The order should satisfy all constraints. If there are muliple solutions, output the one that alphabetically comes first.

                Problem Credits: USACO 2019 December Contest, Bronze; adapted by Sid Banerjee, original problem by Brian Dean <a class = "problem-link" href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=965">here.</a>
                    <br><br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> In the "official" solution to this problem, Nick Wu uses the built-in C++ <a class = "problem-link" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/next_permutation/"><span class = "mid-code">std::next_permutation</span></a> to automatically traverse through the lexicographically ordered permutations of cows (or in this case, books). He can implement complete search because 8! will run well under the time limit (8! is 40320). For this reason, <strong>I recommend finding a solution in another language, as C++ has an "easy" solution.</strong>
